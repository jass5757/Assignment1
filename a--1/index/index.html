                    I'm going under and I fear this time there's no one to save me<br>
                    This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy<br>
                   <span> I need somebody to heal<br></span>
                    Somebody to know<br>
                    Somebody to have<br>
                    Somebody to hold<br>
                    <span>I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain<br></span>
                    And now the day bleeds into nightfall<br>
                    And you're not here to get me through it all<br>
                    I let my guard down<br>
                    And you pulled the rug<br>
                <span>  I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br></span>
                    I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to<br>
                    This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you<br>
                    Now, I need somebody to know<br>
                    Somebody to heal<br>
                    Somebody to have<br>
                    Just to know how it feels<br>
                </span>It's easy to say but it's never the same<br><span>
                    I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape<br>
                    And now the day bleeds into nightfall<br>
                    And you're not here to get me through it all<br>
                    I let my guard down<br>
                    And you pulled the rug<br>
                </span> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br><span>
                    And now the day bleeds into nightfall<br>
                    And you're not here to get me through it all<br>
                    I let my guard down<br>
                    And you pulled the rug<br>
                    I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br>
